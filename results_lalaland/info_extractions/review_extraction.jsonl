\nLa La Land Review \nby Jean-Luc Botbyl \n \nDirector: Damien Chazelle \nWriter: Damien Chazelle \nStarring: Emma Stone, Ryan Gosling \nGenre: Musical/Drama \nI don’t think any movie – ever – has made me feel things in the way that La La \nLand did. \nActually, I don’t know that I’ve ever had a real life experience that’s done what La La \nLand has to me, which is, frankly, astonishing. \nIt’s rare that I see a movie that, in retrospect, makes every other movie I’ve seen \nseem just a tiny bit worse. But La La Land is one of those films. It’s a film brimming \nwith life and energy unlike anything I’ve ever seen. Watching the film unfold before \nmy eyes – it was an experience. One that I will likely never be able to replicate, but I \nwill desperately try to whenever I can. It’s akin to coming out of a concert, and \ndesperately listening to music by that band for weeks after, hoping to capture even a \nshred of the emotions felt in the moment.\n\"\"\"\n\n**Page 2**\n\"\"\"\nLa La Land is a film that is successful on almost every axis, and it really had to, to sell \nwhat it’s doing. This applies especially to the performs, and, surprising no one, both \nEmma Stone and Ryan Gosling were outstanding. The duo share an incredible \nchemistry from their first, speechless, interaction with one another. \nFor a film that is ostensibly a musical, La La Land often relies on quieter moments, \nfree of dialogue or singing. Fortunately, the two leads are adept at handling such \nroles. Their control over their bodies and facial expressions is even more impressive \nthan their ability to deliver their lines. The wide range of performance types in this \nmovie really hammers home just how incredibly talented Stone and Gosling are. \nThey go from conversing to singing and dancing as if it’s nothing, and the bombastic, \noften over the top musical numbers are a pleasure to watch. The choreography and \ncinematography are both excellent, capturing the vibrant emotions conveyed by the \nslightest movements of the performers. \nAnd to be perfectly clear, I’m not a huge of fan of musical numbers in films. I \ngenerally find them distracting and immersion-breaking, but here, they were a treat. \nWhenever one began, I found myself becoming giddy with excitement. \nMy enjoyment of them here stems partially from them being an important element \nof the film – it is, after all, about an actress and a pianist. It’s kind of what they do, \nand expressing themselves to one another, through their art, is more powerful than \nany scrap of dialogue could have been. \nThat being said, I likely could be convinced otherwise, considering the quality of La \nLa Land’s script. It’s compacted to the point where every uttered word feels \nabsolutely necessary. It never gets bogged down in explaining things or overlong \nconversations padded out to add to the run time. No, this is a film in which very little \nactually feels scripted. It’s a story about two humans, and those characters act, \nspeak, and dream like real people. \nAnd it’s this element of the film that explains my emotional reaction to it. I was so \nengrossed in the story of Mia and Sebastian that it became easy to forget that what I \nwas watching wasn’t real. Yeah, that’s something that gets tossed around a lot, and \nI’m certainly guilty of it. What can I say? I’m often prone to hyperbole. But when I \napply that phrase to La La Land, trust me when I say that there is no hyperbole there\n\"\"\"\n\n**Page 3**\n\"\"\"\nat all. \nIt isn’t just the characters that this applies to – it’s the setting as well. While the film \ntakes place in modern day Los Angeles, it manages to also capture an older version of \nthe city. After all, it is an homage to classic films of this genre. There’s even a scene, \nabout halfway through, where the film directly acknowledges this. The moment \napplies to something else that’s going on, of course, but it seems difficult to not miss \nthe self-referential nature of the lines. \nTo be entirely honest, I don’t really have much of an affinity for the so-called “Golden \nAge.” I mean, yeah, I can recognize their importance and impact. But I won’t be able \nto point out every little detail about La La Land that acts as an homage. However, I \nknow the aesthetic, and I do truly love how that is applied to the modern era. \nThere’s very little – nothing, actually – that didn’t impress me about La La Land. It’s \nan intricately crafted, beautiful narrative, one that is truly deserving of every last bit \nof praise. If you haven’t already (or can’t, due to the film being released on three \ndifferent dates, depending on where you live), make it your number one priority to \nsee this film.\n\"\"\"\n\n", "document_id": "doc_165b987d"}
