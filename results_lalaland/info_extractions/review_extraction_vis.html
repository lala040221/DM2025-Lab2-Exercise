La La Land Review 
by Jean-Luc Botbyl 

Director: Damien Chazelle 
Writer: Damien Chazelle 
Starring: Emma Stone, Ryan Gosling 
Genre: Musical/Drama 
I don’t think any movie – ever – has <span class="lx-highlight lx-current-highlight" data-idx="0" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">made me feel things</span> in the way that La La 
Land did. 
Actually, I don’t know that I’ve ever had a real life experience that’s done what La La 
Land has to me, which is, frankly, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="1" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">astonishing</span>. 
It’s rare that I see a movie that, in retrospect, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="2" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">makes every other movie I’ve seen 
seem just a tiny bit worse</span>. But La La Land is one of those films. It’s a film <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="3" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">brimming 
with life and energy unlike anything I’ve ever seen</span>. Watching the film unfold before 
my eyes – <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="4" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">it was an experience</span>. One that I will likely never be able to replicate, but I 
will <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="5" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">desperately try to whenever I can</span>. It’s akin to coming out of a concert, and 
desperately listening to music by that band for weeks after, hoping to capture even a 
shred of the emotions felt in the moment.
&quot;&quot;&quot;

**Page 2**
&quot;&quot;&quot;
La La Land is a film that is <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="6" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">successful on almost every axis</span>, and it really had to, to sell 
what it’s doing. This applies especially to the performs, and, surprising no one, both 
Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling were <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="7" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">outstanding</span>. The duo share an <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="8" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">incredible 
chemistry</span> from their first, speechless, interaction with one another. 
For a film that is ostensibly a musical, La La Land often relies on quieter moments, 
free of dialogue or singing. Fortunately, the two leads are <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="9" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">adept at handling such 
roles</span>. Their control over their bodies and facial expressions is <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="10" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">even more impressive</span> 
than their ability to deliver their lines. The wide range of performance types in this 
movie really hammers home just how <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="11" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">incredibly talented</span> Stone and Gosling are. 
They go from conversing to singing and dancing as if it’s nothing, and the bombastic, 
often over the top musical numbers are <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="12" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">a pleasure to watch</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="13" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">The choreography and 
cinematography are both excellent</span>, capturing the vibrant emotions conveyed by the 
slightest movements of the performers. 
And to be perfectly clear, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="14" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">I’m not a huge of fan of musical numbers in films</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="15" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">I 
generally find them distracting and immersion-breaking</span>, but <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="16" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">here, they were a treat</span>. 
Whenever one began, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="17" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">I found myself becoming giddy with excitement</span>. 
My enjoyment of them here stems partially from <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="18" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">them being an important element 
of the film</span> – it is, after all, about an actress and a pianist. It’s kind of what they do, 
and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="19" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">expressing themselves to one another, through their art, is more powerful than 
any scrap of dialogue could have been</span>. 
That being said, I likely could be convinced otherwise, considering the quality of La 
La Land’s script. It’s compacted to the point where <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="20" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">every uttered word feels 
absolutely necessary</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="21" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">It never gets bogged down in explaining things or overlong 
conversations padded out to add to the run time</span>. No, this is a film in which <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="22" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">very little 
actually feels scripted</span>. It’s a story about two humans, and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="23" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">those characters act, 
speak, and dream like real people</span>. 
And it’s this element of the film that explains my emotional reaction to it. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="24" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">I was so 
engrossed in the story of Mia and Sebastian that it became easy to forget that what I 
was watching wasn’t real</span>. Yeah, that’s something that gets tossed around a lot, and 
I’m certainly guilty of it. What can I say? I’m often prone to hyperbole. But when I 
apply that phrase to La La Land, trust me when I say that <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="25" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">there is no hyperbole there</span>
&quot;&quot;&quot;

**Page 3**
&quot;&quot;&quot;
at all. 
It isn’t just the characters that this applies to – it’s the setting as well. While the film 
takes place in modern day Los Angeles, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="26" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">it manages to also capture an older version of 
the city</span>. After all, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="27" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">it is an homage to classic films of this genre</span>. There’s even a scene, 
about halfway through, where the film directly acknowledges this. The moment 
applies to something else that’s going on, of course, but it seems difficult to not miss 
the self-referential nature of the lines. 
To be entirely honest, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="28" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">I don’t really have much of an affinity for the so-called “Golden 
Age.”</span> I mean, yeah, I can recognize their importance and impact. But I won’t be able 
to point out every little detail about La La Land that acts as an homage. However, I 
know the aesthetic, and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="29" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">I do truly love how that is applied to the modern era.</span> 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="30" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">There’s very little – nothing, actually – that didn’t impress me about La La Land.</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="31" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">It’s 
an intricately crafted, beautiful narrative, one that is truly deserving of every last bit 
of praise.</span> If you haven’t already (or can’t, due to the film being released on three 
different dates, depending on where you live), <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="32" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">make it your number one priority to 
see this film.</span>
